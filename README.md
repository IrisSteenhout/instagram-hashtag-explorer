Instagram hHshtag Explorer
==========================

A small script that connects to the Instagram API with a user's credentials, retrieves the latest media tagged with a specified term, and creates:
- a co-tag network (GDF format) to analyze in gephi
- a tabular file with data on the retrieved media
- a tabular file with user information

This uses the PHP Instagram API wrapper by Christian Metz (https://github.com/cosenary/Instagram-PHP-API).
